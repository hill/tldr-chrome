# tldr-chrome
📚 A chrome extension for [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr).

:construction: **[The Roadmap](todo.md)**

(feel free to contribute :smile:)

## Loading Extension

- The extension is yet to be released to the chrome webstore.
- To load the extension, download the repository and open extension preferences in chrome (go to `chrome://extensions`). Click the box marked `developer mode` and click the button `load unpacked extension...` after which you can navigate to the project directory and load tldr chrome
- Ensure you compile `styles/main.scss` to `styles/main.css`

## How it works
-  Highlight and right click a command on your webpage and select `tldr` in the drop down - a tooltip should appear with information fetched from [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr)
