## Loading Extension

- The extension is yet to be released to the chrome webstore.
- To load the extension, download the repository and open extension preferences in chrome (go to `chrome://extensions`). Click the box marked `developer mode` and click the button `load unpacked extension...` after which you can navigate to the project directory and load tldr chrome
- Ensure you compile `styles/main.scss` to `styles/main.css`
